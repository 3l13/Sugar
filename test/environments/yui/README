YUI unit tests are labrynthine, fragile, and extremely hard to set up.
I made an attempt at an adapter but in the end it would have required a
LOT of hacking on either the tests or the API, which would have defeated
the purpose of keeping track of test breakage in an agile way.
There are even problems with running some of the tests out of the 
box, and some appear be terminally dependent on a network connection.

For the sake of efficiency I will keep the /tests and /build directory
available here for people who are having problems and need to run the tests,
but will only focus on integrating tests into the main test suite on an
individual basis when/if problems are identified.

I will leave a copy of yuitest.html, which seems to be the most relevant
test at the moment, with Sugar alongside as a base reference. If other problems
arise each unit test must include the script and be run individually.
